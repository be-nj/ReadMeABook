> [!NOTE]
> ## 🔱 This fork: multi-library support
>
> This is a fork of [kikootwo/ReadMeABook](https://github.com/kikootwo/ReadMeABook) that adds **multi-library shelves** on top of upstream. Everything below is upstream behaviour; the fork-only additions are:
>
> - **Owned across all libraries** — ownership is detected across every enabled Audiobookshelf library, not just one.
> - **Language/audience routing** — requests are filed into the matching library by language and audience (audience falls back upward only).
> - **Per-shelf Audible region** + a **region switch in search** (browse the German vs. English store).
> - **Per-request override** — the request dialog shows the resolved target library and lets you change it; downgrading the audience (e.g. an adult title into a kids library) is admin-only and gated behind a warning.
>
> Strictly backwards compatible: a single-library setup behaves exactly as upstream and is migrated automatically. See [Multi-library shelves](#-multi-library-shelves) for details. Fork-only items are marked **🔱** throughout this README.

## What is this?

You run Plex or Audiobookshelf with audiobooks. You want more audiobooks. You search indexers, download torrents or NZBs, organize files, wait for your server to scan. ReadMeABook does all of that automatically.

Request a book → Prowlarr searches → qBittorrent or SABnzbd downloads → Files organized → Library imports. Done.

Also includes BookDate: AI recommendations with a Tinder-style swipe interface. Swipe right to request.

User friendly audible-backed searches, multi-file chapter merging, e-book sidecar support, OIDC OAuth, admin approval workflows, and more.

## Features

- **Plex** or **Audiobookshelf**
- **🔱 Multi-library shelves** *(fork)*: Route requests to the right library by language & audience, with per-shelf region and a per-request override
- **Torrents** via qBittorrent
- **Usenet** via SABnzbd
- **Prowlarr** for indexer search (torrents + NZBs)
- **BookDate**: AI recommendations (OpenAI/Claude/Local) with swipe interface
- **Chapter merging**: Multi-file downloads → single M4B with chapters
- **E-book sidecar**: Optional EPUB/PDF downloads from Shadow Library
- **Request approval**: Admin approval workflow for multi-user setups
- **Setup wizard**: Step-by-step guided config with connection testing

## 🔱 Multi-library shelves

> **Fork-only feature** — not in upstream [kikootwo/ReadMeABook](https://github.com/kikootwo/ReadMeABook).

Run more than one Audiobookshelf library (e.g. German, English, and a kids
collection) from a single instance. Each enabled library becomes a **shelf** with:

- an **Audible region** (which also sets the shelf's language for routing),
- an **audience** tier (adult / teen / kids),
- a **media output path** where its downloads are filed.

**Ownership** is detected across *all* enabled libraries (a book counts as owned
if it's in any of them). When you request a book, it's **routed** to the matching
shelf by language and audience — audience only ever falls back *upward* (a kids
title is never filed into an adult-only shelf, and vice-versa). The request
dialog shows the resolved target library and lets you **override** it per request.

**Kids-safety:** filing a book into a library for a *younger* audience than the
book itself (e.g. an adult title into a kids library) is **blocked** — only an
admin can force it, after an explicit warning. This applies to manual overrides;
automatic routing never downgrades on its own.

Searches are **region-aware**: the search bar has a region switch (defaulting to
your primary shelf) so you can browse the German or the English Audible store.

Strictly backwards compatible: a single-library setup behaves exactly as before
and is migrated automatically.

## Setup

**Prerequisites:** Docker, Plex or Audiobookshelf, qBittorrent or SABnzbd, Prowlarr

### Quick Start

```bash
# Download docker-compose.yml
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kikootwo/readmeabook/main/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml

# Start the container
docker compose up -d
```

Open http://localhost:3030 and follow the setup wizard.

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to customize the compose file:

```yaml
services:
  readmeabook:
    image: ghcr.io/kikootwo/readmeabook:latest
    container_name: readmeabook
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3030:3030"
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config
      - ./cache:/app/cache
      - ./downloads:/downloads        # Your download client's path
      - ./media:/media                # Your audiobook library
      - ./pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
      - ./redis:/var/lib/redis
    environment:
      PUID: 1000                      # Optional: your user ID
      PGID: 1000                      # Optional: your group ID
      PUBLIC_URL: "https://audiobooks.example.com"  # Required for OAuth
```

Then run `docker compose up -d` to start.

**Important:** Your download client (qBittorrent/SABnzbd) and RMAB must see files at the same path. See the [Volume Mapping Guide](documentation/deployment/volume-mapping.md) if downloads aren't being detected.

## Built with AI Assistance

This is a human-engineered application. Architecture, design decisions, code review, and project direction are managed by a principal engineer with nearly 15 years of professional software development experience.

AI tools (Claude, GitHub Copilot) serve as force multipliers. Accelerating implementation, maintaining consistency, and handling boilerplate, while human expertise drives the technical vision. This mirrors how AI assistance is used at leading technology companies today.

**The workflow:**
- Token-optimized documentation system designed for AI consumption ([CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md))
- Structured navigation enabling AI to find relevant context without reading entire codebases
- Consistent architectural patterns that AI tools can follow and extend
- Human review of all AI-generated code before merge

The result: enterprise-grade velocity on a solo project without sacrificing code quality or architectural integrity.
